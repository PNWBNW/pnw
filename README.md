# Proven National Workers (PNW)

> **Privacy-first payroll on Aleo.** An end-to-end zero-knowledge payroll framework

## Repository Structure

| Submodule | What It Owns | Links |
|---|---|---|
| [`pnw_mvp_v2`](./pnw_mvp_v2) | All on-chain logic: Leo programs, adapters, commitment primitives, deployment manifests, CI/CD | [GitHub](https://github.com/PNWBNW/pnw_mvp_v2) |
| [`pnw_employment_portal_v1`](./pnw_employment_portal_v1) | All UI and orchestration: Next.js 16 dApp, manifest compiler, settlement coordinator, generative credential art engine, client-side PDF generation, 5-wallet integration | [GitHub](https://github.com/PNWBNW/pnw_employment_portal_v1) |

**Strict boundary:** the portal never owns on-chain logic; the core repo never owns UI. The adapter layer (`src/lib/pnw-adapter/` in the portal, synced from `portal/src/adapters/` in mvp_v2) is the only execution boundary — every on-chain call passes through it.

## How It Works

### The Employer Flow

1. **Connect wallet** — Shield, Puzzle, Leo, Fox, or Soter via the official `@provablehq/aleo-wallet-adaptor-*` package. The wallet provides the Aleo address; the portal never touches private keys.

2. **Register a `.pnw` name** — the employer calls `pnw_name_registrar_v5.aleo::register_employer_name`, which binds a human-readable name (e.g. `acme_corp.pnw`) to their wallet address on-chain. The name hash is used as the employer's identity anchor throughout the system. The `.pnw` name system includes a **full bidirectional resolver** — forward (name → address) and reverse (address → name) — so every surface in the system displays human-readable identities instead of raw Aleo addresses: paystub PDFs, credential card headers, the employer's worker list, and the worker dashboard all resolve `.pnw` names from on-chain data. One name per wallet, soulbound, non-transferable — worker OR employer, not both.

3. **Create an agreement** — the portal encrypts the full employment terms client-side (AES-256-GCM), pins the ciphertext to IPFS via Pinata, and broadcasts a `PendingAgreement` record on-chain via `employer_agreement_v4.aleo::create_job_offer`. Only the employer and worker hold the decryption key, derived from the private `parties_key` field. No plaintext terms touch the blockchain or any server.

4. **Worker accepts** — the worker's wallet receives the `PendingAgreement` as a private record, fetches and decrypts the terms from IPFS, and accepts on-chain via `accept_job_offer`. This mints three `FinalAgreement` records — one for the employer, one for the worker, one for the DAO — binding the two wallets in a cryptographically verifiable employment relationship.

5. **Run payroll** — the employer fills a payroll table in the portal, which compiles it into a deterministic `PayrollRunManifest` (content-addressed by BLAKE3). The settlement coordinator executes each worker's payroll via `payroll_core_v2.aleo::execute_payroll`, which atomically:
   - Verifies the agreement is active (`employer_agreement_v4::assert_agreement_active`)
   - Transfers USDCx privately via Sealance-compliant Merkle exclusion proofs (`test_usdcx_stablecoin::transfer_private`)
   - Mints private paystub receipts for both worker and employer (`paystub_receipts::mint_paystub_receipts`)
   - Anchors a tamper-proof audit event hash (`payroll_audit_log::anchor_event`)

   All four sub-operations execute in a single zero-knowledge proof per worker. Multi-worker runs are sequential with automatic USDCx change-record handling between workers — tested with 3 workers on testnet.

6. **Anchor the run** — after all workers settle, the portal mints a cycle NFT via `payroll_nfts_v2.aleo::mint_cycle_nft` that commits the batch root to the chain for auditability.

7. **Issue credentials** — the employer calls `credential_nft_v3.aleo::mint_credential_nft`, which enforces three cross-program authorization checks before minting:
   - Caller owns the employer's `.pnw` name (`pnw_name_registry_v2::assert_is_owner`)
   - Target address owns the worker's `.pnw` name (`pnw_name_registry_v2::assert_is_owner`)
   - Caller holds an active agreement with the worker, proven via the private `parties_key` commitment (`employer_agreement_v4::assert_employer_authorized`)

   Each mint emits **two** `CredentialNFT` records in a single transition — one owned by the employer (authoritative) and one owned by the worker (visible in their wallet). Both carry the same `credential_id`. Unauthorized mints revert at the contract level.

### The Worker Experience

- **Credentials** — the worker connects their wallet and navigates to the Credentials tab. The portal scans for `CredentialNFT` records owned by the connected address. Each credential renders as a unique generative topographic blueprint card — 1-5 mountain peaks, contour rings, and a profile silhouette, all deterministically derived from the credential's BLAKE3 hash. Four credential types produce four distinct color palettes (cyan, gold, parchment, forest). The worker's `.pnw` name and truncated Aleo address appear in the card header. Workers can download the art as PNG or print a PDF certificate.

- **Paystubs** — the Paystubs tab scans the wallet for `WorkerPaystubReceipt` records. No view key required — the wallet decrypts its own records automatically. Each paystub shows gross, tax, fee, and net amounts in USD with a print button that generates a PDF including the worker's full `.pnw` name, full Aleo address, earnings summary, on-chain transaction references, and cropped credential badge thumbnails.

- **Offers** — pending job offers appear as private `PendingAgreement` records in the worker's wallet. The worker reviews encrypted terms (decrypted locally from IPFS) and accepts on-chain.

The portal compiles manifests, orchestrates settlement, and renders UI. The Leo programs execute, verify, mint records, and anchor commitments. The adapter layer maps between them — the portal never calls `snarkos` directly.

## Privacy Invariants

1. **No sensitive data in any database.** Private keys, view keys, wages, names, and addresses live in session memory only. The portal has no backend server and no database.

2. **No plaintext on public chain state.** Public mappings hold only hashes and commitment anchors — enforced by every Leo program in the stack.

3. **Encrypted agreement terms.** Full employment terms are encrypted client-side (AES-256-GCM) before being pinned to IPFS. Only the two parties hold the decryption key, derived from their private `FinalAgreement` records. No plaintext passes through any server or the blockchain.

4. **Client-side document generation.** PDFs (paystubs, credential certificates, audit authorizations) are generated entirely in the browser using jsPDF. No upload, no third-party PDF service.

5. **Deterministic credential art.** Each credential's visual is a pure function of its BLAKE3 hash — rendered client-side on Canvas, no image stored anywhere. Same hash always produces the same pixels.

6. **Immutable manifests.** The `PayrollRunManifest` is content-addressed by BLAKE3. Changing any row changes the `batch_id`, making tampering detectable.
